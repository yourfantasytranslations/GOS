He identified two armed men guarding the entrance to the building's lobby.

'K-2 rifles, armaments, and body armor.'

He narrowed his eyes and looked around the building and its surroundings. All the windows of the building had blind curtains down. There was no one around, and there was no sign of other humans.

After watching for about 10 minutes, it seemed that no one was guarding the area other than them. He leaned his back low, took cover behind some junk cars, and turned widely to his left, avoiding the eyes of the two guards. The guards were busy chatting with each other.

The man turned to the left, sticking his torso over the car's bonnet, firing his sniper rifle's steering wheel, and shooting at the guard.

As the wind blew away, the sound of scraping metal was heard twice in succession, and the head of the guard closest to the man exploded first, then the head of the other guard also exploded, without him managing to scream in surprise. The man who shot them walked quickly through the door and entered the lobby.

There was no one there. He cautiously went up the stairs. The man he needs to find is on the top floor. The building had about ten floors, so he moved quickly, muffled his footsteps while constantly looking around. As he went up and inside the building, he was filled with increasingly loud conversations from people.

As he went up the stairs to the third floor, he met a man coming down with a paper box full of something and pulled the trigger without hesitation.

The enemy’s head exploded, unable to even scream, while he curled forward. He quickly grabbed the man's clothes and set them down slowly to avoid making a loud noise as the man's corpse hit the floor. However, the box the man was carrying, which he didn't pay attention to, fell and made a huge noise. As he was about to climb the floor again, he paused for a moment and focused on the sounds around him.

The conversation was still audible. Judging that he wasn't noticed, he headed towards the sound.

The door was still open and fixed, so it was perfect to look inside. What used to be a banquet room had been transformed into a residence for the organization that occupied it.

The inside was very spacious and looked to be about 100 pyeong (~330m²), while there were about 10 people in it. Everyone was sitting comfortably on a table and chair, watching a downloaded movie on a computer connected to the TV.

Then, the figure, who appeared to be the middle boss, just pulled his hand off the walkie-talkie and took out the earpiece that he plugged into his ear.

"My big brother wants to tighten our guard."

Everyone groaned and sighed.

"Ha, what else are they gonna do? Is Jaehyuk Moon coming again?"

They didn't have guns around them, as they were just resting there.  He pulled out a flash grenade from a small pouch in the back and pulled out the pin.

"No, he didn't tell me. Tighten your guard and reduce patrol intervals from one hour to 40 minutes. Jongsung and Sungjae take the equipment....”

The man threw a flash grenade in the middle between them.

"Huh?"

The moment the blast of flash temporarily blinded them, the man went inside.

Perhaps because of its use as a banquet room in the past, there was a fluffy carpet on the floor. The man shot once at a time at the heads of those screaming in pain. It took less than 30 seconds to process them all.

Urgent voices were heard from above through the stairs. The man went straight up through the stairs. Fortunately, the enemies seemed less numerous than expected.

"What, what's going on!"

He listened to the sound of fast-approaching footsteps, with his gun in position, as far as possible out of their sight, then shot two times as soon as he encountered someone coming down. The sound of footsteps receded a bit as a terrifying scream was heard behind the corpse, which had been shot down in his chest and stomach.

"Fuck!"

The other one aimed and shot a k-2 at him, but he immediately retreated down the stairs.

The man left alone wasted bullets, apparently frightened.

"Darn it!"

As soon as he tried to pull out the magazine and change it with a new one, he fell down like everyone else with a whoop.

'Fourteen.'

He pulled out a trench gun with Vintorez behind him. After lowering the visor of the helmet, he strode up toward the room with his next goal.

"What happened down there?!"

Voices were heard.

Watching the situation, he stabbed the bayonet without hesitation when somebody appeared at the corner.

"Gasp!"

The bayonet that pierced through the stomach was visible from the back. He pushed the body, falling back, pulled out the bayonet, and pulled the trigger at the person following him.

"Huh?"

A slug bullet was lodged in his chest.

'Sixteen.'

He added numbers inwardly and pulled the doorknob at the targeted location. But the door was locked, and he felt a presence right near the door, so he stepped aside. As soon as he leaned against the wall next to the door, there was a hole in the door with the sound of a pistol. The man inside shouted, "Die! Die!" and fired until the magazine fell.

"Damn it!"

Shortly after that, his gun ticked, saying that the magazine was empty. There were also low-pitched swear words.

It was an opportunity. Without hesitation, the man aimed his trench gun at the doorknob and destroyed it.

A middle-aged man just loading a pistol, Kim Sang-deok, the boss of this organization, was stunned when he saw the man and tried to aim the gun. But the man's fingers were faster, and a slug shot from a trench gun blew up his pistol and hand.

With a terrible scream, Sang-deok fell on his face, grabbing his right wrist.

The man raised the visor, kicked his upper leg, turned him over, and, aiming with the trench gun, looked down.

"Please explain."

A solemn, quiet voice echoed through the screams. It was a pretty cool voice. The situation was the worst, though.

"Hey, what the hell are you talking about? what explanation... ."

Sang-deok's complexion was pale, perhaps because of pain, and he was sweating in a sticky cold sweat.

The man pulled a pistol out of a holster on his back. At first glance, it looked like a pistol (CZ-75), called Czech luxury.

"You're the one who offered me a Czech handgun for the money."

He threw the pistol at the middle-aged man's face. Sang-deok, who had a double nosebleed from the pistol that blasted into his nose, started screaming in pain again.

"Did I ask for a Czech pistol, or did I ask for a fake pistol?"

'Damn, how did you notice that?'

Sang-deok smuggled a North Korean-made Baekdusan pistol, a copy of the Czech pistol, stripped off the 'Baekdusan' engraving unique to North Korea on the lower frame, filled the engraving grooves, painted it, and resold it at a very high price. He's never been caught before. Until now...

"I-I don't know! I heard it's Czech...…."

"You can fool others, but you can't fool me."

The man's voice was cold, as if he had no emotion.

"I asked for an explanation. If you didn't want to be like this in the first place, you should have said sorry from the beginning."

'I have to survive somehow!'

Sang-deok thought about what he had.

"Dude, I'll give you something very good instead. Not from the Czechs, but from Germany, from Germany!"

However, the man was still glaring at Sang-deok with the trench gun in motion.

"And, didn't you say that you are customizing weapons? Let me introduce you to a good Gunsmith! You can't get it unless you're a member! It's a year that even customers get covered!"

"And didn't you say you were customizing weapons? Let me introduce you to a nice Smith! You can't get it if you're not a member! He's the one who picks up his customers!"

As Sang-deok put his hand in the pocket, he aimed a trench gun bayonet at Sang-deok's neck.

"Wait, wait. My, my membership card..."

Sang-deok flinched and offered a golden card with no imprints or letters.

"There is an old two-story white building near Geumgwang 1-dong Community Center in Seongnam City, and the Gunsmith works there. You have to swipe this membership card to open the door."

He picked up the card and put it in his pocket, and Sang-deok, who saw it, smirked bitterly, then put on a poor lamb-like expression before meeting him again.

However, the man's trench gun was still aimed at him.

'Damn it. I was going to give it to the boss.'

Seeing that the gun wasn't moved, Sang-deok frowned and grumbled, reached out, opened the drawer of his desk, took out a hard case, and handed it to the man. The man fixed his eyes on Sang-deok, threw the box on the desk, and opened the lid of the case.

"It's Mark 23. Two more magazines and a silencer."

He removed the gun aimed at Sang-deok and picked up Mark 23 from the box.

"... it's genuine. I've never used it."

At the man's words, Sang-deok smiled sullenly. Then a question popped into his mind. How can you know just by looking at it once?

"Okay, I'll take this."

"Sure…"

And he aimed the trench gun again.

"Hey, you told me you'd let me live!"

"When did I?"

"Please, save me just once. If we succeed in this deal, we can make a lot of money! I'm sorry that I deceived you. Since I'm prioritizing a big deal, I'm busy raising funds… I'll pay you double the money you gave me. Double! Don't you need a girl? There are many shops like that of my acquaintances, and even women..."

The man's bayonet pierced Sang-deok's neck.

With a simmering, moaning sound, Sang-deok grabbed the trench gun's bayonet in his hand, but the man resolutely pulled it out.

He was looking in the air. Although invisible to others, he saw something like a computer window in front of him.

[HK Mk.23 Mod.0 ]

Durability: 100%

Quality: High

Ammo: .45 ACP

It is a pistol produced by Heckler & Koch, Germany, which has not been used at all.

It's a little big, but it's not bad.'

Even though he was wearing a balaclava, the man could not hide his excitement for a moment.

He put a bullet in the barrel, mounted it, and loaded it. Then he adjusted the size of the pistol holster and was about to put the pistol in his holster when he looked out the window. Simultaneously, the pistol was aimed at the window, and the bullet flew out with the sound of the gunshot, then accurately shot into the propeller of a small reconnaissance drone.

A bullet cut off the drone's propeller shaft, and the video ended when it crashed.

***

"…that's great."

As soon as the video ended, the president opened his mouth agape. So did those around him, while some even swallowed their saliva.

But only the general in army uniform was negative.

"That's something our crew can do, too."

However, not anyone can hit a drone the size of an apple, about 100 meters away, with a pistol.

Even more, the drone was flying in the air, and it wasn't stationary.
